## About Me

I’m Chi Zhang – Welly, a senior undergraduate student of Class 2013 majoring in *Computer Science, Zhejiang University*. I’m a research assistant in *State Key Lab of CAD&CG*, advised by [Professor Deng Cai](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/).

My reseach interests include but are not limited to

* Machine Learning
  * Deep Reinforcement Learning
  * Unsupervised Feature Learning

* Computer Vision
  * Recognition
  * Detection
  * Tracking

I was a research assistant at [*VCLA*](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/) for the past summer with [Professor Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/) and I'm now a research intern at *Hong Kong University of Science and Technology* with [Professor Dit-Yan Yeung](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~dyyeung/www/Home.html).
